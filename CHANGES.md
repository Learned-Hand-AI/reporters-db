# Version History

## Future Versions

## Current Version

 - 3.2.2 (2021-06-30): Add F.4th and increment the doomsday clock one notch. 

## Past Versions

 - 3.2.1 (2021-06-04): Fixes bug with format of journals and adds json schemas to prevent regressions

 - 3.2.0 (2021-05-26): Adds federal administrative and executive materials. Adds U.S.C. to laws parsers.

 - 3.1.x: In addition to several regex enhancements, this version brings two new data files. The first file, `laws.json` provides regular expressions for parsing various state laws. The second, `journals.json` does the same for various law journals. 

 Similar our existing data files, these two data files can be imported with `from reporters_db import LAWS, JOURNALS`.

 - 3.0.1: Various improvements to regular expressions

 - 3.0.0: New approach to regexes matches for non-standard reporters (see: `PR #38 <https://github.com/freelawproject/reporters-db/pull/38>`_). Notably, the ``cite_format`` and ``regexes`` fields have been removed from the root reporter object and have been replaced by ``regexes`` and ``examples`` nodes under the ``editions`` key. This allows us to create more granular per-edition examples and regexes.

    We are unaware of any usage of the old keys and they were a beta-quality feature, so we are removing them and moving forward. Get in touch if our assumptions here are wrong.
